# HIREWOLF

##Idea
This was our Project for UTD-Hacks-VII 2021. A little background behind the idea, we as students spend months practicing algorithmic-style coding tests to land our dream job.
However, there remains a massive disconnect between these tests and the actual job. So our group of friends sat together and brainstormed solutions for this problem.
And what we came up with was something that would benefit both recruiters and candidates.

## Presenting HireWolf!!!!

Hirewolf is a online testing platform that caters to all the needs of a recruiter! Our app boasts a wide range of problems which conventional tests do not have. Our sandbox tests allow questions to go beyond and explore the realms of modern frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, Python and many more. The dynamic execution allows users to visualize what they are doing and see thier output with zero latency.

Our questions are set by experts and professionals and test your real-knowledge and experience about a topic over bookish or theoretical concepts. This allows for candidates that are truly deserving and have the skills for the job to get selected. 

## Tech Stack

We built the App using React, Nodejs, and Codesandbox.io.

# Future Scope

We intend to allow candidates to practice various questions to hone their skills and perform better in their jobs.
We also will have challenges which various companies can post or real-world problems that they are facing.
There is a need to change the existing norms of job interviews, so as to benefit both the company and the individual and our vision is to have a product that
pioneers in that journey.
